I am a **Composer, Researcher, Developer, and Improviser** working at the crossroads of **music, technology, and visual arts**. My practice combines **electroacoustic composition**, **free improvisation**, and **real-time multimedia systems**, creating immersive experiences where structured chaos turns into art.

My work draws from traditions of **Stockhausen, Boulez, Nancarrow, Zappa, Reich, Riley, Glass**, while engaging with **modern experimental scenes** in electroacoustics, free improvisation, and algorithmic art.

## 🚀 Core Skills & Technologies

* **Electroacoustic Composition & Performance**: SuperCollider, Max/MSP, Ableton Live
* **Algorithmic & Generative Systems**: Processing, Python, C++ (audio/visual systems)
* **Improvisation & Instrumental Music**: Viola, Strings, Ensembles, Free Improvisation
* **Multimedia & Visuals**: Real-time video scoring, abstraction, interactive systems
* **Poetic & Interdisciplinary Practice**: Text–sound composition, surrealist/modernist influence
* **Research & Collaboration**: Sonology, STEIM lineage, contemporary experimental music
* **Software Development**: Open-source tools, multimedia programming, metaprogramming

## 🌟 Featured Projects

### [Para Lá do Sopro da Noite](#)

*A contrapuntal audiovisual composition for percussion and marimbas, blending Lynchian visuals, electroacoustics, and surrealist poetry.*

### [Granular Xenakis Engine](#)

*A SuperCollider-based generative system for granular synthesis in the style of Iannis Xenakis, with real-time visual scores for improvisation.*

### [Improvisation Systems](#)

*Research on free improvisation languages, extending aspects of Richard Barrett and Jon Rose into hybrid instrumental-electroacoustic performance.*

## 🧩 About Me

* 💡 Always seeking to merge **sound, visuals, and code** into new artistic languages
* 🎼 Advocate for **intuitive composition** and **interdisciplinary experimentation**

👉 Thanks for stopping by! Always open to **collaborations, commissions, and experiments** 👋


Would you like me to make this **more tech-oriented** (like Leonard’s, emphasizing programming/devops/testing) or keep it **artist-researcher focused** (highlighting your interdisciplinary creative work)?
