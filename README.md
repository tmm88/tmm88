### **Composer · Researcher · Developer · Improviser**

I forge connections between **music, technology, and visual art** to create immersive, multisensory experiences. My practice explores the fertile ground between **structure and chaos**, where electroacoustic composition, free improvisation, and real-time multimedia systems converge.

My recent work extends into the intersection of **computer music, generative graphics, and military engineering research**, where I experiment with AI-driven audio-visual simulations, procedural 3D environments, and FPGA-based DSPs. These projects seek to reveal how **creative computation** can enhance not only artistic expression but also complex engineering challenges.

## 🎶 Artistic Practice

My compositions draw from the rhythmic intensity of **Stockhausen** and **Xenakis**, the minimalism of **Reich**, **Riley**, and **Glass**, and my own experiments with:

* **Granular synthesis & spectral processes**
* **Poetic text-to-sound transformations**
* **Contrapuntal works for percussion, strings & electronics**

I design **audiovisual scores** that integrate **video art**, **sound painting**, and **surrealist poetry**, evoking the dreamlike tension of **German expressionist cinema**.

Collaboration is central to my practice: I have curated *Nachtstück Records* and worked with ensembles and institutions like **Vertixe Sonora**, **Stichting Doek**, **Sonology**, and **STEIM** — bridging experimental communities worldwide.

## 💻 Technical Work

I create responsive, real-time systems using:

## Creative Coding

- **Audio:** Ableton, Pd, M4L, MaxMSP, Supercollider, Musescore, FMOD, WWise, JSMidGen, Pydub, JunXion, LiSa, RoSa
- **Graphics:** Processing, P5js, ThreeJS, Cinema 4D, Unity, Unreal Engine, CryEngine

## IT

- **Operative Systems:** MacOS, Windows 10, Windows 11, Arch Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, WSL2
- **Embedded Computing:** Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Alynx and Xylinx FPGAs and Asics 
- **DSP:** getting started to convert some code in supercollider and shadertoy for those lattforms with the assistance of AI, et. al
- **Shell:** MacOS and Linux Bash, Powershell, DOS
- **Core Programming Languages:** C++, Java, Python, NodeJS, some Ruby, wish i could write asm, but at least i know how to use nasm and gcc -S
- **Frontend Frameworks:** React, Angular, Vue, Vite, ThreeJS, P5JS, PhP
- **Virualization:** Virtualbox, Parallels, QEMU
- **Python Frameworks:** recently exploring Flask (pretty easy and straightfoward), Tensorflow, Theano, OpenCV, PyCuda, Sci-kit, Matplotlib, Numba, etc.
- **CMS:** know at least how to use Wordpress

As an open-source enthusiast, I advocate for **modular, minimalist workflows** that democratize access to advanced creative tools.

## 🌍 Current Directions

I am exploring audiovisual compositions influenced by **David Sylvian’s *Manafon***, while engaging with the intellectual rigor of **Darmstadt, Cologne, and Paris circles**. My current research focuses on:

* **WiFi-based networked performance systems**
* **AI-driven improvisation and real-time media synthesis**
* **Interconnected ecosystems for multimedia composition**

I regularly contribute new work to **BBC Radio 3**, **Antena 2**, and **WDR 3**, amplifying experimental voices across international platforms.
