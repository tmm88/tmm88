### **Composer | Researcher | Developer | Improviser**

I am an artist who forges connections between **music, technology, and visual art** to create immersive, multisensory experiences. My work is a continuous exploration of intuition and innovation, blending electroacoustic composition and free improvisation with dynamic multimedia systems. I thrive at the crossroads of different disciplines, crafting a unique space where **structured chaos** becomes art.

## 🎶 Artistic Practice

My compositions draw inspiration from the rhythmic intensity of composers like Stockhausen and Xenakis and the minimalist sensibilities of Reich, Riley, and Glass. I craft sonic worlds using techniques such as **granular synthesis** and innovative **poetic text-to-sound systems** that blur the lines between language and sonics.

In my audiovisual projects, I design contrapuntal works for percussion, strings, and electronics that are both intellectually rigorous and emotionally resonant. These live performances intertwine **video art**, **sound painting**, and surrealist poetry, evoking the haunting aesthetics of **German expressionist cinema**. My goal is to challenge conventional boundaries of performance and storytelling.

My collaborative work extends across the global avant-garde scene. I am a former curator of *Nachtstück Records* and have collaborated with trailblazing ensembles and organizations like **Vertixe Sonora**, **Stichting Doek**, **Sonology**, and **STEIM**, building bridges across diverse experimental communities.

## 💻 Technical Work

As a developer and researcher, I pioneer live electronics with tools like **SuperCollider**, **Processing**, **Pd**, and **Max/MSP**, building responsive and immersive environments. I develop bespoke interfaces and **visual generators** for seamless integration of sound and image.

I am particularly focused on pushing creative boundaries through **AI-assisted composition**, **metaprogramming algorithms**, and **quantum-inspired models**. I'm also an open-source enthusiast, championing minimalist, modular workflows to democratize creativity and make cutting-edge tools accessible to all.

## 🌍 Current Directions

My current work delves into audiovisual explorations inspired by the evocative minimalism of **David Sylvian’s *Manafon*** and the intellectual rigor of the Darmstadt, Cologne, and Paris composer circles. I am advancing research into using **WiFi systems and AI for multimedia composition**, creating responsive, interconnected performance ecosystems.

Through regular contributions to platforms like **BBC Radio 3**, **Antena 2**, and **WDR 3**, I continue to share new work and amplify experimental voices across the globe.
