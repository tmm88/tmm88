## 💻 Technical Work

I create responsive, real-time systems using:

## Creative Coding

- **Audio:** Ableton, Pd, M4L, MaxMSP, Supercollider, Musescore, FMOD, WWise, JSMidGen, Pydub, JunXion, LiSa, RoSa
- **Graphics:** Processing, P5js, ThreeJS, Cinema 4D, Unity, Unreal Engine, TouchDesigner, Shadertoy, Kodelife

## IT

- **Operative Systems:** MacOS, Windows 10, Windows 11, Arch Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, WSL2
- **Embedded Computing:** Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Lillypond, Bella, Alynx and Xylinx FPGAs and Asics 
- **DSP:** getting started to convert some code in supercollider and shadertoy for C++ HLS, Python MyHDL, and Opencl, with the assistance of AI, et. al
- **Shell:** MacOS and Linux Bash, Powershell, DOS
- **Core Programming Languages:** C++, Java, Python, NodeJS, some Ruby, wish i could write asm, but at least i know how to use nasm and gcc -S
- **Frontend Frameworks:** React, Angular, Vue, Vite, ThreeJS, P5JS, PhP
- **Virualization:** Virtualbox, Parallels, QEMU
- **Python Frameworks:** recently exploring Flask (pretty easy and straightfoward), Tensorflow, Theano, OpenCV, PyCuda, Sci-kit, Matplotlib, Numba, etc.
- **CMS:** know at least how to use Wordpress, tried a bit of Drupal, can work with Appache in localhost, as well as MAMP, LAMP, and XAMP 

As an open-source enthusiast, I advocate for **modular, minimalist workflows** that democratize access to advanced creative tools.

## 🌍 Current Directions

I am exploring audiovisual compositions influenced by **David Sylvian’s *Manafon***, while engaging with the intellectual rigor of **Darmstadt, Cologne, and Paris circles**. My current research focuses on:

* **WiFi-based networked performance systems**
* **AI-driven improvisation and real-time media synthesis**
* **Interconnected ecosystems for multimedia composition**

I regularly contribute new work to **BBC Radio 3**, **Antena 2**, and **WDR 3**, amplifying experimental voices across international platforms.

> *“My work is a living canvas where sound, code, and image converge — a space for improvisation, intuition, and the beauty of structured chaos.”*
