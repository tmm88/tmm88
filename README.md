# 👋 Tiago Morais Morgado  

🎼 **Composer | Researcher | Developer | Improviser**  
I weave **music, technology, and visual art** into immersive experiences, fusing electroacoustic composition, free improvisation, and live coding with dynamic multimedia systems. My work thrives at the crossroads of intuition, innovation, and structured chaos.

## 🎶 Artistic Focus  
- **Electroacoustic Composition & Free Improvisation**  
  - Drawing inspiration from visionaries like Stockhausen, Xenakis, Reich, Riley, and Glass, while engaging with the spontaneity of contemporary improvisers.  
  - Crafting sonic landscapes through **granular synthesis**, **real-time visual scoring**, and innovative **poetic text-to-sound systems** that blur the lines between sound and meaning.  

- **Audiovisual Projects**  
  - Creating contrapuntal works for percussion, strings, and electronics that resonate with emotional and intellectual depth.  
  - Designing live performances that intertwine **video art**, **sound painting**, and **surrealist poetry**, evoking the haunting aesthetics of **German expressionist cinema** and **experimental montage**.  
  - Exploring multisensory storytelling that challenges conventional boundaries of performance.  

- **Collaborations**  
  - Former curator of *Nachtstück Records* (2013–2024), fostering experimental music communities.  
  - Collaborating with trailblazing ensembles and organizations like **Vertixe Sonora**, **Stichting Doek**, **Sonology**, **STEIM**, and **RIO ensembles**, building bridges across global avant-garde scenes.

## 💻 Technical Work  
- **Programming & Interactive Systems**  
  - Pioneering live electronics with **SuperCollider**, **Processing**, **Pd**, and **Max/MSP** to create responsive, immersive environments.  
  - Developing **OSC/ControlP5 interfaces** and bespoke **visual generators** for seamless integration of sound and image.  
  - Pushing boundaries with **AI-assisted composition**, **metaprogramming algorithms**, and **quantum-inspired models** to explore new creative frontiers.  

- **Open Source Enthusiast**  
  - Championing minimalist, modular workflows using vintage and open-source DAWs to democratize creativity.  
  - Experimenting with cutting-edge **open-source software** for music and visual media, fostering accessibility and innovation.

## 🌍 Current Directions  
- Expanding audiovisual explorations inspired by the evocative minimalism of **David Sylvian’s *Manafon***, the visceral intensity of **God of Single Cell Organisms**, and the intellectual rigor of the **Darmstadt, Cologne, and Paris composer circles**.  
- Advancing research into **WiFi systems + AI for multimedia composition**, creating responsive, interconnected performance ecosystems.  
- Forging new pathways between **poetry, sound, and real-time systems**, where language and sonics collide in unpredictable ways.  
- Sharing my work through regular contributions to radio platforms like **BBC Radio 3**, **Antena 2**, **WDR 3**, and **Concertzender**, amplifying experimental voices.
