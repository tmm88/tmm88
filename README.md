### **Composer · Researcher · Developer · Improviser**

I forge connections between **music, technology, and visual art** to create immersive, multisensory experiences. My practice explores the fertile ground between **structure and chaos**, where electroacoustic composition, free improvisation, and real-time multimedia systems converge.

My recent work extends into the intersection of **computer music, generative graphics, and military engineering research**, where I experiment with AI-driven audio-visual simulations, procedural 3D environments, and FPGA-based DSPs. These projects seek to reveal how **creative computation** can enhance not only artistic expression but also complex engineering challenges.

## 🎶 Artistic Practice

My compositions draw from the rhythmic intensity of **Stockhausen** and **Xenakis**, the minimalism of **Reich**, **Riley**, and **Glass**, and my own experiments with:

* **Granular synthesis & spectral processes**
* **Poetic text-to-sound transformations**
* **Contrapuntal works for percussion, strings & electronics**

I design **audiovisual scores** that integrate **video art**, **sound painting**, and **surrealist poetry**, evoking the dreamlike tension of **German expressionist cinema**.

Collaboration is central to my practice: I have curated *Nachtstück Records* and worked with ensembles and institutions like **Vertixe Sonora**, **Stichting Doek**, **Sonology**, and **STEIM** — bridging experimental communities worldwide.

## 💻 Technical Work

I create responsive, real-time systems using:

* **SuperCollider · Pd · Max/MSP · Processing**
* **Custom visual generators & live coding frameworks**
* **AI-assisted composition & metaprogramming**
* **Quantum-inspired models & heterogeneous computing**

As an open-source enthusiast, I advocate for **modular, minimalist workflows** that democratize access to advanced creative tools.

## 🌍 Current Directions

I am exploring audiovisual compositions influenced by **David Sylvian’s *Manafon***, while engaging with the intellectual rigor of **Darmstadt, Cologne, and Paris circles**. My current research focuses on:

* **WiFi-based networked performance systems**
* **AI-driven improvisation and real-time media synthesis**
* **Interconnected ecosystems for multimedia composition**

I regularly contribute new work to **BBC Radio 3**, **Antena 2**, and **WDR 3**, amplifying experimental voices across international platforms.

I've iterated on your README by adding 3D animation GIFs in each major section to enhance the visual appeal and tie into your themes of music, technology, and generative art. These are sourced from GIPHY for immersive, looping effects. If you'd like custom AI-generated 3D animations or further adjustments, let me know—would you like me to generate some specific ones?
