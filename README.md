## About Me

I am a composer, improviser, backend developer, digital signal processing specialist, and sound & computer graphics expert, seamlessly blending aavant-garde artistry with cutting-edge technology. With advanced degrees in computer music and sonology, paired with classical training in viola and piano, I craft emotionally resonant, interdisciplinary works that bridge music, code, and visuals. My practice draws inspiration from the Darmstadt, Cologne, and Paris avant-garde scenes, channeling their experimental ethos into innovative compositions, performances, and software solutions.

## Professional Expertise

### Composer
Crafting original, emotionally evocative music across genres—classical, electronic, experimental, and cinematic—designed to resonate with diverse audiences.

- **Creative Process**: Composes using Ableton Live, Logic Pro, and LilyPond, tailoring works to narratives or moods. Integrates Python and AI (e.g., Magenta) for algorithmic composition, exploring novel harmonic and timbral landscapes.
- **Applications**: Created scores for short films, video games, and immersive installations, including a generative ambient soundtrack for an interactive art exhibit.
- **Impact**: Produces culturally relevant works performed in concert halls and digital platforms, with premieres on BBC Radio 3 and Antena 2.

### Improviser
Delivering dynamic, spontaneous performances that captivate through real-time musical expression.

- **Performance Expertise**: Skilled in live improvisation on piano, guitar, and modular synthesizers, responding to audience energy or collaborative cues.
- **Contexts**: Performed at jazz ensembles, experimental festivals, and live-coding events using SuperCollider and Ableton Push for layered soundscapes.
- **Collaborative Artistry**: Improvises with dancers and visual artists, integrating AI-driven visuals for multi-sensory experiences.

### Backend Developer
Building scalable, high-performance systems to power innovative applications.

- **Technical Proficiency**: Develops RESTful APIs and microservices with Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), and Java (Spring Boot). Manages SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases.
- **DevOps Practices**: Implements CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes, optimizing for AWS deployments.
- **Use Cases**: Engineered backend systems for real-time audio streaming platforms, achieving low-latency communication via WebSocket.

### Digital Signal Processing Specialist
Designing advanced audio processing algorithms for high-fidelity, real-time applications.

- **Core Skills**: Develops DSP algorithms (e.g., reverb, pitch shifting) using C++ (JUCE), Python (NumPy, SciPy), and hardware-accelerated platforms like FPGAs via HLS.
- **AI Integration**: Enhances DSP with TensorFlow for tasks like noise reduction, trained on custom audio datasets.
- **Applications**: Built low-latency audio pipelines for music production, live performances, and VR/AR spatial audio.

### Sound & Computer Graphics Expert
Fusing immersive audio with cutting-edge visuals for transformative experiences.

- **Audio-Visual Integration**: Combines Three.js and Tone.js for synchronized 3D visualizations and spatial audio in VR and live performances.
- **Creative Coding**: Uses p5.js and Processing for generative art, mapping audio parameters to real-time visuals.
- **Applications**: Developed audio-reactive installations for museums and festivals, integrating with Unity and Unreal Engine.

## Current Directions and Research

My work explores the intersection of avant-garde artistry and emerging technologies, inspired by David Sylvian’s *Manafon* and the experimental legacies of Darmstadt, Cologne, and Paris. I focus on three areas:

### WiFi-Based Networked Performance Systems
- **Innovation**: Developed WebRTC/WebSocket-based platforms for low-latency (sub-20ms) networked performances, premiered on BBC Radio 3 and Antena 2.
- **Applications**: Enabled global ensembles to improvise seamlessly, integrating OSC with DAWs like Ableton Live.

### AI-Driven Improvisation and Media Synthesis
- **Approach**: Trained RNNs and transformer models (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for real-time audio-visual generation, premiered on WDR 3.
- **Impact**: Created installations where audience movements drive AI-generated soundscapes and GLSL visuals.

### Interconnected Multimedia Ecosystems
- **Framework**: Built modular pipelines with Python (music21), JavaScript (Tone.js), and C++ (JUCE) for audio-visual composition.
- **Applications**: Developed mixed-reality performances with Ambisonic audio and WebXR visuals for Paris festivals.
