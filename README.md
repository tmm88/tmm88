# 👋 Hi, I'm Tiago Morais Morgado  

🎼 **Composer | Researcher | Developer | Improviser**  
I work at the intersection of **music, technology, and visual art**, combining electroacoustic composition, free improvisation, and live coding with multimedia systems.

## 🎶 Artistic Focus  
- **Electroacoustic Composition & Free Improvisation**  
  - Blending influences from Stockhausen, Xenakis, Reich, Riley, Glass, and contemporary improvisers.  
  - Integration of **granular synthesis**, **real-time visual scoring**, and **poetic text-to-sound systems**.  

- **Audiovisual Projects**  
  - Contrapuntal works for percussion, strings, and electronics.  
  - Live performances combining **video art, sound painting, and surrealist poetry**.  
  - Exploration of **German expressionist cinema** and **experimental montage**.  

- **Collaborations**  
  - Former curator of *Nachtstück Records* (2013–2024).  
  - Connections with **Vertixe Sonora**, Stichting Doek, Sonology, STEIM, and RIO ensembles.

## 💻 Technical Work  
- **Programming & Interactive Systems**  
  - Live electronics with **SuperCollider**, **Processing**, **Pd**, and **Max/MSP**.  
  - Real-time **OSC/ControlP5 interfaces** and custom **visual generators**.  
  - Interest in **AI-assisted composition**, **metaprogramming algorithms**, and **quantum-inspired models**.  

- **Open Source Enthusiast**  
  - Minimalist, modular workflows with older or open-source DAWs.  
  - Experimentation with **modern open-source software** for music and visual media.  

---

## 🌍 Current Directions  
- Expanding audiovisual work influenced by **David Sylvian’s Manafon**, **God of Single Cell Organisms**, and the Darmstadt/Cologne/Paris composer circles.  
- Continuing research in **WiFi systems + AI for multimedia composition**.  
- Building bridges between **poetry, sound, and real-time performance systems**.  
- Donating pieces regularly to radio (BBC Radio 3, Antena 2, WDR 3, Concertzender).
