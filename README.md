## 🌍 Current Directions and Research

My work explores the intersection of technology and artistry, inspired by David Sylvian's album *Manafon* and the intellectual traditions of the Darmstadt, Cologne, and Paris avant-garde scenes. Key focus areas include:

- **WiFi-Based Networked Performance Systems:** Developing low-latency, collaborative platforms for distributed musicians and performers.
- **AI-Driven Improvisation and Real-Time Media Synthesis:** Leveraging machine learning to generate adaptive audio-visual content in live settings.
- **Interconnected Ecosystems for Multimedia Composition:** Building modular frameworks that integrate sound, code, graphics, and emerging technologies for holistic creative expression.

I actively contribute experimental compositions and performances to international platforms, including BBC Radio 3, Antena 2, and WDR 3, fostering global dialogue in contemporary music.
